[rank0]:[W1123 01:12:24.141922283 ProcessGroupNCCL.cpp:4115] [PG ID 0 PG GUID 0 Rank 0]  using GPU 0 to perform barrier as devices used by this process are currently unknown. This can potentially cause a hang if this rank to GPU mapping is incorrect.Specify device_ids in barrier() to force use of a particular device,or call init_process_group() with a device_id.
